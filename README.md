Learning blockchain A-Z

Learning about blockchain programming can be confusing. There isn't a single document will all the info about blockchain.
I am taking time attending online courses, practice and research to put everyting into one document.


In this repository, i will be pushing new projects that i exercised on.


Blockchain, smart contracts, Miners, Web3 and Dapps. What are those?

To start off, blockchain is the heart of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is like a server program. While miners are the actual servers that run the Blockchain. Unlike AWS server, the miners are decentralized, no one owns them.

Web3 is just a term to represent an era in the web industry.
    - Web1, 1994-2004, are websites that were static without any user interactions. Just text and images.
    - Web2, 2004-present, websites oriented towards user interactions (social media for example).
    - Web3 is still new, we are currently moving towards Web3. It's basically an era where websites and mobile apps use Dapps.

                                                                                            Credit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-1-0-web-2-0-and-web-3-0-with-their-difference/

Now that i mentioned Dapps, What is it? Some might confuse Web3 with Dapps (Decentralized applications), they are realated but not the same. Web3, as i said, is just a term. Web3 uses Dapps. 
Dapps is where all the fun work happens. It is basically the technical part of Web3. Think of it as client side program.

While smart contracts are server side programs. Smart contracts are functions inside the server program (Blockchain).

Now that the definitions are cear, let's put everything in an example.
    Let's say you want an online store, you want to allow crypto payments. How do you do it? The website will be centralized (since you'll host it on AWS or AZURE) but everything realted to the crypto will be decentralized. On the "Client side", you'll have Dapps which will connect your website with the blockchain. BUT, you can't simply connect your website to it, you need a way to communicate and to translate Business logic into a programming. Hence, the smart contracts. Remember, smart contract is just a "Function" not the server program ("Blockcahin"), which you'll need. You got your function and the server program, where do you run it? ON THE MINERS.
